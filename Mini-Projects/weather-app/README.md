# Weather App

This project aims to create a versatile weather app that provides users with real-time weather information. It's designed to help users stay informed about the weather conditions in their location and in other cities they may be interested in. This app is a great starting point for those interested in Android app development with Java.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data:** The app fetches current weather data, including temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more, using a reliable weather API.

- **Location-Based Weather:** Automatically detects the user's current location and displays local weather. Users can also manually search for weather information in other locations.

- **Multi-Day Forecasts:** Provides multi-day weather forecasts, helping users plan for the days ahead.

- **Weather Icons:** Displays intuitive weather icons to represent different weather conditions, making it easy for users to understand the forecast.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a clean and user-friendly interface, including search functionality and a detailed weather display.

- **Settings:** Allows users to customize units (e.g., Fahrenheit or Celsius), choose between dark and light themes, and set other preferences.
